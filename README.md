Facial recognition attendance system

This facial recognition attendance system consists of three main components. First, there's the facial recognition section, which enables users to clock in using facial recognition. Second, there's the admin section, granting admin users the ability to manage user profiles by adding, deleting, or modifying information and images stored in a local folder. Lastly, there's the teacher section, allowing teachers to access specific attendance reports.
